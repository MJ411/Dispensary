					Cannabinoids are compounds unique to cannabis, and there have been over 100 different cannabinoids identified. The most well known cannabinoid is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is responsible for the “high” of cannabis and can affect perception, mood, emotion, cognition, and motor function. But there are also cannabinoids like cannabidiol (CBD) which are non-psychoactive yet have been demonstrated to possess medically useful properties. 
					Mostly THC amounts is 10 to 100 times greater than that of CBD due to years of breeding for recreational use.
					Cannabis doesn’t directly make the most famous cannabinoids associated with the plant, THC and CBD. Instead, it synthesizes several cannabinoid acids. These cannabinoid acids must be “activated” (decarboxylated), usually by heat, to yield the compounds that most consumers are after (THC or CBD). But in addition to THCA and CBDA, there are number of related cannabinoid acids that can be produced by Cannabis.</br>
					</br>Here are a few we know more of so far:</br>
					</br>CBGA (Cannabigerolic acid) + HEAT = CBG (Cannabigerol)</br>
						THCA (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) + HEAT = THC (Δ9–tetrahydrocannabinol)</br>
						CBDA (Cannabidiolic acid) + HEAT = CBD = (Cannabidiol)</br>
						CBCA (Cannabichromenenic acid) + HEAT = CBC (Cannabichromene)</br>
						CBGVA (Cannabigerovarinic acid) + HEAT = CBGV (Cannabigerivarin)</br>
						THCVA (Tetrahydrocanabivarinic acid) + HEAT = THCV (Tetrahydrocannabivarin)</br>
						CBDVA (Cannabidivarinic acid) + HEAT =  CBDV (Cannabidivarin)</br>
						CBCVA (Cannabichromevarinic acid) + HEAT = CBCV (Cannabichromevarin)</br>
					</br>Following decarboxylation, each of the cannabinoid acids yields a corresponding cannabinoid compound:</br>

                      The term “entourage effect” has been used to describe the synergistic manner in which the more than 80 cannabinoids and 100+ terpenes work together to produce the healing magic that cannabis is so widely recognized for. Specifically, the entourage effect combines the ability of these various compounds that helps to neutralize and minimize the psychoactive effects of cannabis, which could possibly be too intense in reality to stand alone.

                      When the separate components present in cannabis stand alone, they aren’t nearly as strong or effective as when combined together. This teamwork is greater than the sum of all the individual parts, hence the term “entourage”, which means a group of people surrounding and supporting another main individual.

                      Understanding that all the additional components within the marijuana plant work together can actually benefit the marijuana community. For example, terpenes are the components that give cannabis its scent and taste, but aside from this rather superficial responsibility, terpenes also seem to change the way in which cannabinoids bind to their respective receptors, thus altering the way in which cannabinoids take effect internally.

					  In this manner, terpenes act along with cannabinoids in a collective effort to promote various medically-beneficial effects. Terpenes have many healing properties, including reducing inflammation, increasing sedation, relieving pain, and lessening depression and anxiety. When paired up with cannabinoids, however, they are that much more effective because they actually alter the way in which the already-beneficial cannabinoids function.

					  The “entourage effect” and focusing on how you can receive the most well-rounded medicine, or as some call it “whole plant medicine”, then it is quite simple. Take a Full-Spectrum oil or consume the raw plant.
					  Fresh herb has nearly 100 cannabinoids present in it and even more terpenes, so the crop itself is well-balanced and packed full with variety.
